# TermX
*"Innovation in it's purest form"* - the TermX team

# About
TermX was first built in Python within a week by me and some friends who unfortunately are not on GitHub. Similar to Z# (TermX is based on Z#), visual capabilities are present. I have already developed most of the TermX REPL, and you can execute TermX code with the runtx command. Here is some sample TermX code:

```
displaytext | "Hello World!"
printput | "This prints your input!"

```
There is also VisualTermX, which has code like this:
```
draw cir | 0&0 | 0&0&0 | 50&50
```
The above code draws a white circle at 0,0 that is 50 pixels tall and 50 pixels wide.
The original version had Fortran-esque syntax. At the moment, the TermX team is very close to implementing if/else statements, which can allow bootstrapping for TermX.
